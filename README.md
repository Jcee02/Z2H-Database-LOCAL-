Requirements for functioning database:
- Store information (variable lenght)
- Add entries to database
- Update entries in the database
- Store info to a file
- Load and edit database file
- Search by different parameters

Just toying around with some database manager made with C using POSIX file descriptors
To read number of items in .db either way echo -ne it with a custom binary or edit it 

Usage: ./bin/(mach-o executable) <filename>.db 





Looking forwards adding more complexity to this code in later days.
