Requirements for functioning database:
- Store information (variable lenght)
- Add entries to database
- Update entries in the database
- Store info to a file
- Load and edit database file
- Search by different parameters

Just toying around with some database manager made with C using POSIX file descriptors
To read number of items in .db either way echo -ne it with a custom binary or edit it 

Currently testing -n (new entry) and -f command line flags.

TO:DO
Flag for parsing an entry

Looking forwards adding more complexity to this code in later days.
